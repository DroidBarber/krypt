# krypt-app
Web 3.0 has the potential to change the internet as we know it, forever.</br>
In this project we learn how to : <br/>
•Connect a regular React.js application to the blockchain and pair it to a Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.</br>
•Write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the Solidity programming language.</br>
•Essentially, how to create a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain.
